# Postmortem: Web Stack Outage Incident

## Issue Summary:

### Duration:
**Start Time:** October 15, 2023, 10:45 AM (UTC-4)
**End Time:** October 15, 2023, 2:30 PM (UTC-4)

### Impact:
The outage affected the availability of our primary web service, resulting in a 30% degradation in user experience. Users reported slow page loading times, intermittent errors, and in some cases, complete unavailability of the service during the incident.

### Root Cause:
The root cause of the outage was identified as a misconfigured update in the load balancer settings, leading to uneven distribution of traffic and overloading specific servers.

## Timeline:

**10:45 AM:** Issue detected through monitoring alerts indicating an increase in error rates and latency.

**10:50 AM:** Engineering team alerted; initial assumption was a potential database overload due to increased traffic.

**11:15 AM:** Investigation focused on database queries and load. No significant issues found. Assumption adjusted to possible network congestion.

**12:00 PM:** Network analysis inconclusive. Escalated incident to DevOps and Infrastructure teams.

**12:30 PM:** Further investigation revealed misconfigured load balancer settings, causing uneven distribution of traffic.

**1:00 PM:** Load balancer configurations rolled back to the last known good state as a temporary fix.

**2:30 PM:** Full resolution achieved by fine-tuning load balancer settings and implementing stricter change control processes.

## Root Cause and Resolution:

### Root Cause:
The misconfiguration in the load balancer settings led to a disproportionate distribution of traffic across servers. Some servers were overwhelmed, resulting in increased response times and errors for users.

### Resolution:
The issue was resolved by rolling back the load balancer configurations to the previous known good state. Further, adjustments were made to distribute traffic more evenly, and additional monitoring was implemented to quickly detect and prevent such misconfigurations in the future.

## Corrective and Preventative Measures:

### Improvements/Fixes:

**Enhanced Monitoring:** Implement more robust monitoring for load balancer configurations and traffic distribution patterns.
Automated Testing: Introduce automated tests for load balancer configurations as part of the deployment pipeline.
Documentation Review: Conduct a comprehensive review of documentation related to load balancer configurations to ensure accuracy and clarity.
Tasks to Address the Issue:

**Automated Rollback Script:** Develop and implement a script for automated rollback of load balancer configurations in case of issues.
Training: Conduct training sessions for the operations team on proper load balancer configuration management.
Change Control Process: Strengthen the change control process to include additional review steps for critical infrastructure changes.
This incident highlighted the importance of rigorous monitoring, quick detection, and a well-defined incident response process. The corrective measures and tasks identified aim to fortify our infrastructure against similar issues in the future, ensuring a more resilient and reliable web service for our users.
